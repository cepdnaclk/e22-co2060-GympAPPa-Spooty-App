### GympAPPa Spooty App – Pera Sports & Gymnasium Management System

GympAPPa Spooty App is a web-based application designed to improve the management and utilization of sports facilities and gymnasium resources at the University of Peradeniya.

Currently, activities such as borrowing sports equipment, checking court availability, organizing matches or tournaments, and sharing sports-related announcements are handled manually or through scattered communication methods. This leads to inefficiencies, lack of real-time updates, and difficulties in coordinating sports activities among students.

Our proposed solution is a centralized platform that allows students, sports staff, and administrators to manage all sports-related operations through a single system. The application will support real-time tracking of equipment issued from the counter, display availability of courts and grounds, and help students find playing partners or form teams for various sports.

Additionally, the system will allow users to create and join tournaments, publish event announcements and flyers, and provide live score updates for official matches and inter-university competitions.
